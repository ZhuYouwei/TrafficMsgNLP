## Objective:

The objective of this project is to transform the traffic report message in English to a structured record.
For each traffic report message, the structured record is an array of key-value pairs. The key is the
attribute name we concerned such as location and current status. The value is the attribute value we get
from this traffic report message. Using this structured record, further visualization or analysis could be
done in order to help road user to understand the traffic report without reading the message. The road user can then
evaluate the influence of this traffic condition.
